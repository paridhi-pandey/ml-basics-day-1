The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is a non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It operates on the principle that similar data points tend to exist in close proximity within a feature space.
learned the basics of supervised learning and built a KNN classifier on the Iris dataset to understand how classification models work in practice.
